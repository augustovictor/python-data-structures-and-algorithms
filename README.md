## Big O notation

This notation provides an upper bound on the growth rate of a function.

It describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends to a particular value or infinity.

Time complexities examples
- O(1) - swap two numbers;
- O(logN) - Search in a sorted array with binary search;
- O(N) - Search for a max element in an unsorted array;
- O(N*logN) - Mergesort, quicksort, heapsort;
- O(N^2) - bubble sort
- O(2^N) - Travelling salesman problem with dynamic programming;
- O(N!) - Traveling salesman problem with brute force search;

Try to reduce algorithms complexity to `linear` or `logarithmic` time complexity.
